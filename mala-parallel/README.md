This ðŸ¤—[**MaLA-LM/mala-bilingual-translation-corpus**](https://huggingface.co/datasets/MaLA-LM/mala-bilingual-translation-corpus) is the MaLA bilingual translation corpus, collected and processed from various sources. 
As a part of [**MaLA Corpus**](https://huggingface.co/collections/MaLA-LM/mala-corpus-66e05127641a51de34d39529) that aims to enhance massive language adaptation in many languages, it contains bilingual translation data (aka, parallel data and bitexts) in 2,500+ language pairs (500+ languages). 

The [**MaLA Corpus** (Massive Language Adaptation)](https://huggingface.co/collections/MaLA-LM/mala-corpus-66e05127641a51de34d39529) is a series of comprehensive, multilingual datasets designed to support the continual pre-training of large language models. This [**MaLA-LM/mala-bilingual-translation-corpus**](https://huggingface.co/datasets/MaLA-LM/mala-bilingual-translation-corpus) set can also support the training of multilingual translation models.
