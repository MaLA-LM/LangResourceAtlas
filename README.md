# LangResourceAtlas: A Comprehensive Map of Language Resource Categorization

## About

`LangResourceAtlas` is a curated repository providing a comprehensive categorization of over 500 languages into "high," "medium," and "low" resource groups based on their digital linguistic data availability. This initiative aims to serve as a foundational resource for researchers, developers, and practitioners working on multilingual Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, especially those focusing on less-resourced languages. We aim at:

- **Standardizing Resource Levels:** Offering a shared reference for understanding language resource availability across a wide spectrum of languages unified into ISO 639-3 standard and writing systems in ISO 15924 standard.
- **Consolidating Information:** Bringing together insights from various prominent datasets and research efforts into a single, accessible location.

# Data Sources

The categorization in `LangResourceAtlas` is informed by a careful analysis and synthesis of information derived from, but not limited to, the following critical data sources and research initiatives:

- **FineWeb:** Large-scale web-crawled text data, providing insights into monolingual text availability.
- **MaLA Corpus:** A multilingual corpus (including both monolingual and parallel), designed for adapting language models into massively multilingual scenario.
- **Joshi et al. (2020)**: A study that looks at the relation between the types of languages, resources, and their representation in NLP conferences to understand the trajectory that different languages have followed over time. [Joshi, P., Santy, S., Budhiraja, A., Bali, K., & Choudhury, M. (2020).
